<h1>HOW IT WORKS</h1>

<h3>For Students</h3>
	<h4>1. Find a Tutor </h4>
		<p>Browse our list of Ivy League tutors and their available times. </p>
	<h4>2. Request a Lesson </h4>
		<p> Once you find your tutor, choose a time that works for you and request a lesson. You pay one lesson at a time; no need for upfront payment. YOu can cancel up to 24 hours before the lesson if necessary and get a full refund (minus a small transaction cost.) </p>
	<h4>3. Enjoy Your Lesson </h4>
		<p> Your tutor will send you a contact request via Skype a day before the lesson. Please log into Skype at least 10 minutes before the lesson. Enjoy your lesson! </p>

<h3>For Tutors</h3>
	<h4>1. Create Your Account </h4>
		<p>Sign up as a tutor and create your own account. All you have to do is to write a little bit about yourself and your qualifications. You can set your own price, of which you will receive 80% if a student signs up. </p>
	<h4>2. List Your Lessons </h4>
		<p> Choose a time that will definitely work for you, say, Nov. 25th 7-8pm, and list it under your profile. You will get an email if a student chooses your time slot. </p>
	<h4>3. Conduct Your Lesson </h4>
		<p> Send your student a Skype contact request at least a day before the lesson. Find a quiet place and sign into Skype at least 20 minutes before the lesson.</p>
